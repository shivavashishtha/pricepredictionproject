# Data Science Project 
<br>

## Motivation
Within this project we will further analyze the Bengaluru House price data By <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/amitabhajoy">AmitabhaChakraborty </a>
To find the house pricing on the basis of given data 
<br>

## File Description
<ul>
<li>In the repository we have all survey files as .csv downloaded from the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data">Kaggle </a> site.</li>
<li>In order to simplify data loading process files were renamed to have a consistent naming convention (' Bengaluru_House_Data.csv ')</li>
<li>Beside the input files there is one Jupyter Notebook file with all code used for the analysis including comments.</li>
 </ul> 

## Installation
The files are attached with the jupyter notebook within the repository
Python libraries used
The following imports are required in order to execute all functions in the notebook:
<ul>
  <li>import numpy as np</li>
  <li>import pandas as pd</li>
  <li>import os</li>
  <li>import seaborn as sns</li>
  <li>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt</li>
  <li>import matplot </li>
  <li>from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression</li>
  <li>from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split</li>
</ul>
